FIRST AND FOREMOST: PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THE BOOTSTRAP CONFIG FOLDER
UNLESS YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING
WE SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED TO TOUCH THAT MORE THAN ONCE

UNDERSTANDING THE ARCHITECTURE:

EACH SUB FOLDER WITHIN STYLESHEETS FOLDER CAN HAVE MANY FILES
PARTIALS SHOULD START WITH A _ (ex: _navbar.scss)
THEY ARE CALLED PARTIALS BECAUSE THEY SHOULDN'T BE COMPILED
AS STANDALONE OBJECTS
EACH OF THOSE SUBFOLDERS CONTAINS AN INDEX.SCSS
NEW STYLESHEETS SHOULD EACH BE COMPILED IN THAT INDEX FILE

SO FOR EXAMPLE, SHOULD YOU WRITE A NEW LAYOUT PAGE, YOU WILL IMPORT
THAT PAGE INTO THE INDEX OF THAT FOLDER

IMPORTING FILES INTO THIS FIRST INDEX:
@import "filename"

THEN, THOSE INDEXES SHOULD BE IMPORTED INTO THE FILE application.scss
THAT STANDS IN THE SHARED FOLDER

TO IMPORT IN THAT INDEX PAGE:
@import "foldername/filename"

----

JUST FOR A QUICK RECAP
COMPONENTS - ELEMENTS THAT WILL BE RENDERED IN MULTIPLE PAGES (navbar, buttons, etc)
CONFIG - BOOTSTRAP VARIABLES (TOXIC AREA - DON'T TOUCH)
LAYOUTS - THE PLACE WHERE WE CREATE UNIVERSAL STYLES (fonts, background colors, etc)
PAGES - STYLES SPECIFIC TO A CERTAIN PAGE, LIKE HOME, ETC (SHOULDN'T BE USED TOO MUCH IF THE REST IS WORKING FINE)
SHARED - SHOULDN'T BE TOUCHED FOR THE MOMENT / MIGHT EVOLVE

----

DON'T USE IDs UNLESS YOU NEED. PREFER CLASSES WITHIN DIFFERENT DOCUMENTS (REFER TO THE RECAP ABOVE)
DON'T USE REDUNDANT CODE
DON'T NEST CSS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING
DIVS: CONTROVERSIAL BUT USEFUL - TO BE USED MOSTLY ON PAGES, OVERRIDING/COMPLEMENTING STYLES FROM THE LAYOUT FOLDER


----

AS FOR THE HTML, KEEP OBJECTS IN THE SHARED FOLDER IF THEY'RE GONNA BE RENDERED MORE THAN ONCE (NAVBARS, FOOTERS ETC)
